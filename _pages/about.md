I am **Jianle Sun (孙健乐)**, currently pursuing my M.S. (research-based) degree in the Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My researching field includes statistical genetics and genomics, causal inference, computational and statistical methods in multi-omics data, and Bayesian analysis. I have also collaborated on epidemiological cohort studies, and done intern research on AI for Science. Before this, I received my B.S. degree in Biotechnology in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

***I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Computational Biology, Biostatistics, or Statistical Genetics.*** You can find my resume here: [JianleSun's CV](../files/CV_JianleSun.pdf)

Reseach interests
======
* Statistical genetics & genomics methodology (GWAS, post-GWAS, eQTL, TWAS, etc.), and its application to human complex traits <br>
* Causal inference & causal discovery methods in multi-omics data (e.g., Mendelian randomization, structure equation modeling, causal representation learning for single-cell omics) <br>
* Statistical & computational (machine learning & deep learning) methods for single-cell multi-omics intergration, especially cell-specific epigenomic and transcriptomic functional analysis on risk variants identified by GWAS, and temporal & spatial models <br>
* Longitudinal modeling & causal effect estimation in epidemiology

You can find the list of my publications and read the papers [here](https://sjl-sjtu.github.io/publications/).

I have a keen interest in many aspects of nature, society, and the humanities. I am one of the initiators of the student Philosophy Society in SJTU, where I organized and participated in seminars on philosophy and the history of science. I also have over a year of experience studying classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit.
