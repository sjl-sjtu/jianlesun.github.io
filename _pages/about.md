I am **Jianle Sun (孙健乐)**, currently pursuing my M.S. (research-based) degree in the Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My researching field includes statistical genetics and genomics, causal inference, computational and statistical methods in multi-omics data, and Bayesian analysis. I have also collaborated on epidemiological cohort studies. Before this, I received my B.S. degree in Biotechnology in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

***I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Computational Biology, Biostatistics, or Statistical Genetics.*** You can find my resume here: [JianleSun's CV](../files/CV_JianleSun.pdf)
