I am **Jianle Sun (孙健乐)**, currently pursuing my M.S. in the Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My researching field includes statistical genetics and genomics, causal inference, computational and statistical methods in multi-omics data, and Bayesian analysis. Before this, I received his B.S. in Biotechnology in 2021 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

***I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Computational Biology, Biostatistics, or Statistical Genetics.*** You can find my CV here: [JianleSun's CV](../files/CV_JianleSun.pdf)
